✈️ Passenger Behavior Snapshot: India–UK Flight by Rapid Air

This dashboard offers a data-driven view into passenger dynamics on an India–UK route, with a total of 242 passengers generating a ticket revenue of ₹6M. Here’s what the numbers tell us:

📊 Key Passenger Insights
1. Age Distribution

The largest group of travelers is aged 52, followed closely by those aged 21 and 24.

This mix suggests a blend of older leisure travelers and younger, possibly work-related flyers.

2. Gender Composition

Males make up the majority at 55.5% (132 passengers), while females account for 45.5%.

This mild gender skew could reflect travel purpose, industry, or cultural travel patterns.

3. Adult vs. Child Travelers

The flight is primarily adult-dominated: over 200 adults vs. a small number of children.

Suggests this is not a family-heavy leisure route but rather individual, business, or student travel.

🌍 Frequent Flyer Patterns
4. Country of Origin

Passengers originating from India far outnumber those from the UK.

This route is more India-outbound, likely reflecting student travel, visiting family, or business migration.

5. Cabin Class Preferences

Economy dominates frequent flyer activity, followed by Business, and a small share in First Class.

Loyalty is clearly strongest in Economy class—indicating repeat travelers value affordability and access over luxury.

🔍 Observations
There's high repeat travel from India, mostly in Economy class, suggesting price sensitivity.

Passenger age groups skew young and mid-life, which could inform airline marketing (e.g., student/young professional offers).

Low number of children suggests limited appeal for family tourism—this could be a business/student-driven route.

✅ Recommendations
Offer loyalty perks and bundled services for Economy frequent flyers, especially those traveling between 21–24 and 50+.

Explore dynamic pricing or targeted campaigns for the 50+ demographic, who appear to have strong travel presence.

Family-oriented incentives are not a priority here—instead, focus on solo, business, and student travelers.

Strengthen India-facing marketing, as the route is heavily outbound from India
